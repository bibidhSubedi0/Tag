 Tag

**Status:** Incomplete (First Prototype - Contains Bugs)

## Overview

**Tag** is an experimental environment designed for Reinforcement Learning (RL) projects. The goal is to simulate a tag game where agents, such as chasers and runners, interact within a defined space. This environment can serve as a testbed for developing and evaluating various RL algorithms.

## Features

- **Agents:** Implementation of `Chaser` and `Runner` classes representing the entities in the game.
- **Player Class:** A base class for agents, providing common functionalities.
- **Utilities:** Helper functions to support game mechanics.
- **Main Game Loop:** The core loop managing the interactions between agents.
